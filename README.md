# Logo Generator 

## Description

The logo generator creates unique logos based on user input for the background color, text color, shape, and text. The three shapes available are circles, triangles, and squares. This application allows someone who is unfamiliar on logo design an easy solution. Through building the logo generator I learned about svg graphics and how to build them as well as how to build functioning tests.

## Installation

To install the readme generator, first ensure that you have installed inquirer using the "npm install -y". This will install the default node modules needed for inquirer. To ensure you are able to run the tests, install jest by entering "npm install jest" in the command line. Next, in the command line enter "node index.js". You will be prompted with four questions about the color of the background and text, as well as the shape and text for the logo. Once you have completed the questions the logo.svg file with automatically update with the required code for your logo. Drag it into your browser to view your logo.
